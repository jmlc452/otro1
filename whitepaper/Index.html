                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        First of all we want to welcome you to Battle Hero, the first game which will reward you directly every minute you spend on it, both in fun and economically. Remember that Battle Hero is Free to Play and Play to Earn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Battle Hero's project intention was from the very start to create an NFT game where users could be rewarded when they play it, as more hours are spent playing and enjoying this fun game more coins will be redeemned by them. This game was developed by and for players.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What sets us apart from our competence is the "All Included Model" that we provide, where you can enjoy the game in different ways, in a more active way playing every day and opting to be the best in tournaments, leagues, events ... or simply staking your characters and visiting the game daily to see your daily rewards or maybe you just want to play to open chests and make your team stronger and more valuable. Remember that Battle Hero has its own marketplace where you can trade, sell and buy any hero or weapon with Battle Hero as an intermediary in a quick, easy and secure way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you can see Battle Hero is not just a game, it is the result of solving an accumulation of needs that we consider necessary in any NFT game. Thanks to Unity and its 3D game technology we have been able to create more than 5000 possible combinations between heroes, weapons and rarities and 5 maps that will be available in the final version of the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember that each Hero or Weapon has an unique gene that defines it. According to our numbers there are more than 1 million total combinations. In addition, each Hero or Weapon has 5 rarities with 4 different stats + 1 training level. These stats range in value from 1 to 1XX depending on their rarity, but if this wasnt good enought, think about this, you can combine each Hero and Weapon as you want, isnt it great? That increases its rarity, power and value in the market. ¡BOOM! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But... What about the 3D In-Game modes? You'll be amazed, as of today we already contemplate 5 In-Game game modes 1vs1, 5vs5, 10vs10 and an all vs. all of 10.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any type of player is rewarded with tokens. Whether they are stacking players, In-Game 3D players or  marketplace players as everything is fully compatible.

                    <p >Token Burning/ BuyBack</p>
                    <p>As mentioned before, $BATH will be the only token in the game's economy. So it will be used for opening chests, buying and selling in the marketplace, merging, participating in tournaments and an infinite number of other things that will cause the constant use of the token. All transactions that rewards us directly will generate token burnings of up to 80% of the cost of each purchase and the other 20% will be distributed again among all players, avoiding that every day more tokens are created than those that are burned. This makes $BATH deflationary by fact.</p>

                        We want to give everyone the opportunity to participate in the start of the game, so we have divided the distribution of tokens in 3, where everyone will be able to participate, forming a total of 12% of the total supply of BATH tokens. There will be between all of them: 120.000.000 BATH in circulation. Remember that 25% of the BATH purchased will be delivered monthly in order to improve the economy of the token and to make sure that the token is not devaluated.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, if you have purchased 1000 BATH, you will receive 250 at purchase, 250 after 30 days, 250 after 60 days and 250 after 90 days. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The minimum purchase will be 0.01 BNB.

                    <p>All 3 NFTs no matter if they are weapons or heroes they all must be the same hero or weapon. You cannot upgrade different types. For example: If you want to upgrade a Bear Hero from Rare to Epic, you must have 3 Rare Bear NFTs.

                    <p>The resulting NFT is not random. If you merge NFTs of higher level, you will have more probability of obtaining an NFT with better statistics.
